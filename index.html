									JUSTIN GOTTSCHLICH, PH.D. </a>
								<h2 class="keynote-subtitle">Inventor, Leader, and Visionary in Machine Programming</h2>
								<p class="main"> <b>Justin Gottschlich, a Senior Staff Research Scientist at Intel
										Labs</b>, is a prominent figure in artificial intelligence (AI)
									and machine learning (ML). His research in AI focuses on machine programming,
									anomaly detection, neural network verification,
									deep learning, and autonomous systems. Currently, he leads a team of AI researchers
									in the Programming Systems Research Group
									at Intel Labs, where he is the lead principal investigator and co-founder of the $6M
									Intel-NSF joint CAPA Research Center,
									which aims to simplify the programmability of heterogeneous computing. He also is
									responsible for directing Intel’s portfolio
									of intellectual property related to machine programming (MP).

								<div id="collapse-speaker" style="display:none">
									<p class="main"> Much research and engineering must be done before autonomous
										systems, like autonomous vehicles (AVs), can be fully realized.
										Contrary to some AV experts’ opinions, it is Gottschlich’s belief that anomaly
										detection must advance significantly before we
										will reach level 4+ autonomy. He believes that the current state of the art is
										not nearly advanced enough to be used reliably
										and a level 3-only AV can put human lives at unnecessary risk. Sadly, this is
										partially why we have seen a rising number of
										tragic AV fatalities.
									</p>
									<p class="main"> To help address this problem, in December 2018, Gottschlich et al.
										published a paper at NeurIPS ’18, entitled
										<a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/7462-precision-and-recall-for-time-series.pdf"
											target="_blank">“Precision and Recall for Time Series”</a>
										which re-defined the core mathematical foundation for the field of AD so the
										detection systems built using this new foundation
										could be more reliable, especially in the context of time series. To that end,
										Gottschlich’s hope is that this work could
										be used to improve the general robustness of new AD systems and eventually save
										human lives. To date, this model has already
										been adopted by BMW, Intel, and Stanford.
									</p>
									<p class="main"> In the same year, Gottschlich, along with his fellow collaborators
										at MIT, published
										<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FvztwHyfgmrPMdE0lkTLidnhjl2wHCrm/view"
											target="_blank">“The Three Pillars of Machine Programming (MP),”</a>
										detailing the ground-breaking efforts that are leading to significant
										advancements in software development productivity by partially or
										fully-automating
										software development tasks that are currently performed manually. They lay down
										a blueprint of how to fully unlock the power of MP and provide a
										roadmap for its future evolution. Gottschlich's work in this area is significant
										because it is key to the strategic vision of several industry
										leaders (e.g., BMW, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft). In fact, Facebook's creation
										of an <a
											href="https://siliconangle.com/2018/09/13/facebook-created-ai-based-tool-automate-bug-fixes/"
											target="_blank">
											AI-based tool to automate bug fixes in 2018</a> is an example of the
										“Adaptation Pillar” that Gottschlich wrote about in his paper.
									</p>
									<p class="main"> Recent advancements in ML-centric computational hardware (e.g.,
										GPUs, distributed computing, neural processors, etc.), key algorithmic
										discoveries and
										techniques, and the vast amount of learning data now available are some of the
										reasons why interest in MP has exploded and why Gottschlich is fascinated
										with this field of research.
									</p>
									<p class="main"> In 2016, he co-founded the ACM Machine Learning and Programming
										Languages (MAPL) workshop, and subsequently has been the chair and the program
										chair of MAPL and
										TRANSACT. Previously, Gottschlich was the vice-chair of the C++ Standard
										Transactional Memory Working Group (SG5) during 2012 to 2014.
									</p>
									<p class="main"> Gottschlich has led major projects and collaboration initiatives at
										some of America's top corporations, startups, and research working groups. He
										oversees and guides several Intel-driven ML research
										projects at top universities such as Berkeley, Brown, MIT, Stanford, Texas A&M,
										and the University of Washington. He has mentored some of the smartest minds at
										America's top universities to solve
										the problem of how to effectively build software for diverse hardware
										architectures.
									</p>
									<p class="main"> In the corporate realm, Gottschlich oversaw an industrial
										collaboration between Intel and BMW on anomaly detection for autonomous
										vehicles. Gottschlich was previously the director of engineering at
										Machine Zone, where he oversaw the development of the popular video games,
										Mobile Strike and Game of War. He is also the CEO of Nodeka, LLC, an online,
										multi-player software gaming company that he founded in 1999.
									</p>
									<p class="main"> On the research front, between 2015 and 2018, Gottschlich was
										awarded 20+ patents, with 50+ still pending. He also has 30+ peer-reviewed
										publications and has given 12+ presentations at conferences and
										seminars at BoostCon, BMW, IBM Research, Penn, VMWare Research, etc. He won the
										“Best Presentation” award at several conferences (Intel SWPC 2016, CGO 2010, and
										Raytheon ISaC 2009).
									</p>
									<p class="main"> Gottschlich received his Ph.D. from the University of Colorado in
										Boulder, where he occasionally teaches a graduate-level course on neural
										networks. Last fall, at the University of Pennsylvania,
										he co-lectured a graduate-level course on anomaly detection for safe autonomy.

									Gottschlich as a major influencer in the field of safe autonomy, thanks to his
									groundbreaking work in advancing the unification of academia and industry to
									collectively solve some of the most challenging technical
									issues facing the world today.

								<div id="collapse-precise" style="display:none">
									<p class="main white">
										Gottschlich is a spearpoint when it comes to intelligent,
										safety-critical systems. His early work focused on algorithms, parallel and
										distributed computing, computer architecture, embedded systems,
										software/hardware efficiency,
										C/C++ systems optimization, software programability and productivity. Since
										then, Gottschlich's focus has shifted, and his more recent contributions are
										centered around intelligent, autonomous systems, with a strong emphasis on
										anomaly 
										detection. His work in this area of research is considered, by many, to be the
										defacto standard in the industry, due to his expansive knowledge of the
										implementation of physical systems, and the significant impact of his
										innovations in the field.
									</p>
									<p class="main white">
										Gottschlich constantly strives to leverage AI for the advancement and benefit of
										people and society.  He represents a rare breed of researcher whose full-stack
										experience enables him to see problems in 
										unique ways that elude other researchers. Leveraging this foresight, Gottschlich
										has become a force multiplier in the Assured Machine Learning community by
										coordinating with Intel to fund and actively participate in foundational and
										translative research focused on real-world problems plaguing AI systems.  We
										believe their cutting-edge work will be critical to advancing the next
										generation of safe, intelligent systems.
									</p>
									<p class="main white">
										PRECISE is truly honored to host Dr. Justin Gottschlich as our Keynote
										Speaker for Industry Day 2019, and give him the spotlight and recognition
										that he aptly deserves.
