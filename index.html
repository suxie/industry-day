						Let’s come together on Oct 25th to drive cross-industry discussion on "Safe AI" and enable an
						autonomous tomorrow.
					</h2>
					<p>
						Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) have taken off in recent years, and have
						advanced to the point where they are beginning to become integrated into our daily lives.
						However, one area of AI/ML that is still in its infant stages and warrants much needed
						attention is "Safe Autonomy". Safety in AI-based systems is critical and undoubtedly one of
						the most difficult challenges to solve. At PRECISE's 6th Annual Industry Day Conference,
						experts from both industry and academia will gather to present about and discuss this topic
						in depth, across various industries (automotive, medical, etc.). You will learn about the
						latest advancements in the field of "Safe AI", and have the unique opportunity to network
						with subject matter experts to share information and be part of a movement that is taking AI
						to the next level in its evolution.
					</p>

									JUSTIN GOTTSCHLICH </a>
								<h2 style="margin-bottom:9">Inventor, Leader, and Visionary in Machine Programming</h2>
								<img class="intel" src="assets/intel_ai.png">
								<img class="intel" src="assets/intel_labs.png">
								<p class="main">Justin Gottschlich leads Intel’s research and development in machine
									programming (MP). Complementary to MP, his research revolves around deep learning,
									anomaly detection, machine learning verification, and autonomous systems. Currently,
									he leads a team of AI researchers for machine programming systems at Intel Labs. He
									is also the lead principal investigator and co-founder of the $6M Intel-NSF joint
									CAPA Research Center, which aims to simplify the programmability of heterogeneous
									computing. He also directs Intel’s portfolio of intellectual property related to MP.

								<div id="collapse-speaker" style="display:none">
									<p class="main"> Much research and engineering must be done before autonomous
										systems, like autonomous vehicles (AVs), can be fully realized. Contrary to
										some AV experts’ opinions, it is Gottschlich’s belief that anomaly detection
										must advance significantly before we will reach level 4+ autonomy. He
										believes that the current state of the art is not nearly advanced enough to
										be used reliably and a level 3-only AV can put human lives at unnecessary
										risk. Sadly, this is partially why we have seen a rising number of tragic
										AV fatalities.
									</p>
									<p class="main"> To help address this problem, in December 2018, Gottschlich
										et al. published a paper at NeurIPS ’18, entitled
										<a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/7462-precision-and-recall-for-time-series.pdf"
											target="_blank">“Precision and Recall for Time Series”</a>
										which re-defined the core mathematical foundation for the field of automated
										driving (AD) so the detection systems built using this new foundation could
										be more reliable, especially in the context of time series. To that end,
										Gottschlich’s hope is that this work could be used to improve the general
										robustness of new AD systems and eventually save human lives. To date, this
										model has already been adopted by BMW, Intel, and Stanford.
									</p>
									<p class="main"> In the same year, Gottschlich, along with his fellow collaborators
										at MIT, published
										<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FvztwHyfgmrPMdE0lkTLidnhjl2wHCrm/view"
											target="_blank">“The Three Pillars of Machine Programming (MP),”</a>
										detailing the ground-breaking efforts that are leading to significant
										advancements in software development productivity by partially or
										fully-automating
										software development tasks that are currently performed manually. They lay down
										a blueprint of how to fully unlock the power of MP and provide a
										roadmap for its future evolution. Gottschlich's work in this area is significant
										because it is key to the strategic vision of several industry
										leaders (e.g., BMW, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft). In fact, Facebook's creation
										of an <a
											href="https://siliconangle.com/2018/09/13/facebook-created-ai-based-tool-automate-bug-fixes/"
											target="_blank">AI-based tool to automate bug fixes in 2018</a> is an
										example of the
										“Adaptation Pillar” that Gottschlich wrote about in his paper.
									</p>
									<p class="main"> Recent advancements in ML-centric computational hardware (e.g.,
										GPUs, distributed computing, neural processors, etc.), key algorithmic
										discoveries and techniques, and the vast amount of learning data now
										available are some of the reasons why interest in MP has exploded and
										why Gottschlich is fascinated with this field of research.
									</p>
									<p class="main"> In 2016, he co-founded the ACM Machine Learning and Programming
										Languages (MAPL) workshop, and subsequently has been the chair and the program
										chair of MAPL and TRANSACT. Previously, Gottschlich was the vice-chair of the
										C++ Standard Transactional Memory Working Group (SG5) during 2012 to 2014.
									</p>
									<p class="main"> Gottschlich has led major projects and collaboration initiatives at
										some of America's top corporations, startups, and research working groups. He
										oversees and guides several Intel-driven ML research projects at top
										universities such as Berkeley, Brown, MIT, Stanford, Texas A&M, and the
										University of Washington. He has mentored some of the smartest minds at
										America's top universities to solve the problem of how to effectively build
										software for diverse hardware architectures.
									</p>
									<p class="main"> In the corporate realm, Gottschlich oversaw an industrial
										collaboration between Intel and BMW on anomaly detection for autonomous
										vehicles. Gottschlich was previously the director of engineering at
										Machine Zone, where he oversaw the development of the popular video games,
										Mobile Strike and Game of War. He is also the CEO of Nodeka, LLC, an online,
										multi-player software gaming company that he founded in 1999.
									</p>
									<p class="main"> On the research front, between 2015 and 2018, Gottschlich has over
										25
										issued patents, with around 100 still pending. He also has 30+
										peer-reviewed publications and has given dozens of presentations and
										seminars at Berkeley, BMW, IBM Research, Penn, Stanford, VMWare
										Research, etc. He is a prolific public speaker with many speaking awards
										at various conferences such as Intel SWPC 2016, CGO 2010, and Raytheon
										ISaC 2009.
										<p class="main"> Gottschlich received his Ph.D. from the University of Colorado
											in Boulder, where he occasionally teaches a graduate-level course on neural
											networks. Last fall, at the University of Pennsylvania, he co-lectured a
											graduate-level course on anomaly detection for safe autonomy.

										programability and productivity. Since then, Gottschlich's focus has shifted,
										and his more recent contributions are centered around intelligent,
										autonomous systems, with a strong emphasis on anomaly detection. His work
										in this area of research is considered, by many, to be the defacto standard
										in the industry, due to his expansive knowledge of the implementation of
										physical systems, and the significant impact of his innovations in the field.
									</p>
									<p class="main white">
										Gottschlich constantly strives to leverage AI for the advancement and benefit of
										people and society. He represents a rare breed of researcher whose full-stack
										experience enables him to see problems in unique ways that elude other
										researchers. Leveraging this foresight, Gottschlich has become a force
										multiplier
										in the Assured Machine Learning community by coordinating with Intel to fund and
										actively participate in foundational and translative research focused on
										real-world problems plaguing AI systems. We believe their cutting-edge work
										will be critical to advancing the next generation of safe, intelligent systems.

								challenges this presents for guaranteeing safety. These
								technologies are also being investigated for use in manned and
								unmanned aircraft. However, machine learning algorithms and

							<p><u>ABSTRACT</u>: Humans are heavily involved in inspection, transport, navigation and
								delivery activities around the shop floor where flexibility is paramount, such as in
								robotic inspection or delivery of parts and tools with transportation vehicles.
								Currently, two main driverless transportation vehicle types are considered in the
								industry (at two different ends, and everything in between): automated guided vehicles
								(AGV) and self-driving vehicles (SDV). AGVs move over fixed paths in a highly controlled
								manner, utilizing predefined paths, beacons, magnetic tape, barcodes, etc. There is
								little decision making based on the live environment around the vehicle other than the
								safety stop. On the other hand, SDVs and other types of mobile robots operating in
								semi-structured environments with trained personnel, rely heavily on advances in
								Artificial Intelligence to self-drive or move in a less constrained manner, understand
								their environment and react in real time. They exploit rich information received from
								their environment by leveraging sensors (lasers, wheel encoders, infrared detectors,
								high resolution RGB-Depth cameras, etc.). Present mobile robots carrying parts and tools
								can achieve large speeds (5-10m/s) and thus project danger under the prospect that the
								robot hits a person. They would adapt movement speed to the level of human agility (0-2
								m/s) depending on the perception of human activity and possible contact situations with
								a person within the robot’s envelope. The need for AGVs to operate safely without human
								intervention while increasing the trust of human operators is a significant ongoing
								challenge. This talk will address fail-safe architectures for AGVs in the wider sense of
								the AGV acronym referring to autonomous, self-driving systems and techniques for
								ensuring human and material safety during autonomous operation. While safety-related
								parts of control systems are traditionally locked at design and implementation time, we
								will discuss how these could be adapted based on experience, what is a sufficiently
								powerful formulation to include safety during the learning process, and what new
								challenges it brings in adopting such approaches today.</p>

							<p><u>ABSTRACT</u>: Despite great advances and successful technology demonstrations in the

								to be contributing to a growing graveyard of autonomy technology. Because stakeholders
								and investors do not have the information necessary to assess risk and benefits

								processes have helped creating air transportation systems, medical devices, and other
								safety critical systems with stellar records in safety and reliability. However, success
								may be ascribed to many factors, including conservatism and reliance on human qualities
								such as good judgment and “safety culture.” Autonomy introduces complexity that cannot
								be addressed through prevailing assurance processes. At Lockheed Martin Advanced
								Technology Laboratories, we are working on solving for the gap between autonomy and
								assurance. In this talk, we will present an overview of the challenges and how they
								translate to specific technology gaps requiring joint efforts from academic and
								industrial research communities. We will also describe a vision for how assurance
								processes for autonomous system could look like in a not so distant future.

							<p> <u>ABSTRACT</u>: Autonomous systems in the Aerospace and Defense (A&D)
								sector cover a broad range of missions and domains from
								spacecraft-asteroid rendezvous where distances from earth are such
								that real-time communication is not possible to helicopter search and
								rescue (SAR) missions in harsh and challenging weather environments
								where pilots need to rely on autonomy to avoid fatal controlled
								flight into terrain. These autonomous systems compose, select and
								execute courses of action with varying levels of human interaction
								to ultimately aid humans to accomplish complex tasks and missions.
								Increasingly, Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML)
								capabilities are being considered to address these complex missions
								as well as to evaluate collaboration between multiple systems.
								Across the spectrum of systems and missions, there is also a variable
								level of determinism to be considered. Systems can range from fully
								deterministic such as autopilot flight controls to highly
								non-deterministic such as command and control systems that learn and
								respond to dynamic environments and tasking.
							</p>
							<p> A key challenge in the A&D sector is for both operators and the test and
								evaluation (T&E) and safety communities to develop “trust” in these
								highly complex integrated hardware/software systems [of systems]. The
								A&D community approaches trust at both the individual human
								operator/partner level and at the organizational level. Both need to be
								able to assume an autonomous system will operate as expected. At the
								organizational level, the T&E community needs the appropriate
								verification and validation (V&V) methodologies and tools to certify and
								approve the system. Likewise, the safety community needs the system to
								work within an existing or evolving regulatory framework. In addition,
								these communities are facing pressures between maintaining high levels
								of safety within growing markets and technology developments on the
								international level.
							</p>
							<p> Today, the T&E and safety communities are focusing on fully
								deterministic systems, but are acutely aware of the need to address
								increasing non-determinism in the near future driven by the rapid
								expansion of applications of AI/ML and the supporting high performance
								computational (HPC) infrastructure. To increase the ability of these
								communities to accept and certify autonomous systems, current systems
								engineering approaches need to be bolstered with additional
								methodologies in the requirements and V&V phases. The complexity of the
								challenge requires context-specific integration of approaches ranging
								from formal methods to large scale synthetic simulation. Ultimately, as
								with any new technology, the regulatory community need to feel
								comfortable with the technologies and approval processes and it is
								incumbent on the developmental community to work hand in hand with them.

							<p><u>ABSTRACT</u>: Current deep learning frameworks are very powerful and expressive
								but hard to use productively and hard to optimize for high performance. Often it is
								very difficult to diagnose correctness and performance issues since these frameworks
								are layered on implementation artifacts like computation graphs. In this talk we
								present a programming model for deep learning which is based on ideas from functional
								programming and polyhedral compilation. Our programming model uses advanced type
								systems and shape inference to ease the task of writing robust and correct deep
								learning models. The model also enables modular construction of complex models from
								simpler ones and is amenable to polyhedral optimization which is a mathematical
								abstraction for expressing complex optimizations.

							<p> <u>ABSTRACT</u>: Autonomous Vehicles are in the news every day but there is still
								a long road ahead for the companies working on them. Autonomous Vehicle (AV)
								simulation will play a huge role in the testing and certification of AV
								technology and is also a critical engineering tool used in the daily development
								and testing of AV technology. Professional but proprietary automotive simulation
								tools can cost $100,000 USD, and while open source simulators are also available,
								most have limited functionality and require a great deal of custom programming
								in order to integrate them with autonomous driving software.
							</p>
							<p> The LGSVL Simulator (including the required 3D models, high definition maps,
								and photo-realistic digital environments) changes all of that. Designed and
								built by autonomous engineers in LG’s Silicon Valley Lab, the LGSVL Simulator
								has built-in support for popular open source AV software stacks like Autoware
								and Apollo, and with ROS and ROS2 support, it can easily integrate with other
								proprietary driving software. In addition, it’s free and because it’s open
								source it’s easy for engineers to adopt and extend it for their own needs
								(as many have already), rather than starting from scratch to build their own.

						<p> <u>ABSTRACT</u>: Autonomous vehicles (AVs) have already driven millions of miles on public
							roads, but even the simplest maneuvers such as a lane change or vehicle overtake have not
							been certified for safety. Current methodologies for testing and verification of Advanced
							Driver Assistance Systems such as Adaptive Cruise Control cannot be directly applied to
							determine AV safety as the AV actively makes decisions using its perception, planning and
							control systems for both longitudinal and lateral motion. These systems increasingly use
							machine learning for which it is fundamentally hard to derive safety guarantees across a
							range of driving scenarios and environmental conditions. New approaches are needed to bound
							and minimize the risk of AVs to assure the public, determine liability and insurance pricing
							and ensure the long-term growth of the domain. Our autonomous vehicle computer-aided design
							(AV-CAD) toolchain will capture formal descriptions of driving scenarios in order to develop
							AV safety cases. The use of synthetic environments and real DoT traffic feeds will also be
							demonstrated to evaluate machine learning and decision control algorithms for future AVs. Be
							prepared to see lots of AV crashes and how AV-CAD is used for testing and verification in

						<p> <u>ABSTRACT</u>:
							Emerging research shows that program synthesis and machine learning can
							play mutually beneficial roles to transform the way we build software.
							The goal of program synthesis is to allow programmers to specify the
							desired computation in intuitive ways without having to write
							traditional code. We will share our framework of "Syntax-Guided
							Synthesis" as a unifying formalization of the computational problem
							common to a wide range of synthesis problems such as program
							optimization, program repair to fix security vulnerabilities, and
							learning programs from examples

						<p> <u>ABSTRACT</u>: The remarkable benefits of static analysis at finding security
							vulnerabilities and harmful bugs early in the software development
							process are offset by long-standing challenges in aspects such as
							accuracy, scalability, and generalizability. I will describe how to
							address these challenges by making static analysis continuous, in three
							senses of the word: (1) seamlessly combining discrete and continuous
							modes of logical reasoning in static analysis, (2) deploying static
							analysis in continuous integration/deployment (CI/CD) settings, and (3)
							continuously improving and adapting static analysis over time with weak
							or no supervision.

						<p> <u>ABSTRACT</u>: As computer architectures become ever more complex and heterogenous,
							optimizing for each platform becomes increasingly difficult. Our "Feedback-Driven
							Processors", which uses performance counter data from live executions to discover
							performance bugs and automatically repair them, will allow programs to adapt to
							their current platform and run-time conditions without needing programmer effort.
