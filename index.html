							<a class="keynote-speaker" href="https://sites.google.com/view/gottschlich" target="_blank"> JUSTIN GOTTSCHLICH, PH.D. </a>
							<h2 class="keynote-subtitle">Inventor, Leader, and Visionary in Machine Programming</h2>
							<p class="main"> Justin Gottschlich, a Senior Staff Research Scientist at Intel Labs, is a prominent figure in artificial intelligence (AI) 
								and machine learning (ML). His research in AI focuses on machine programming, anomaly detection, neural network verification, 
								deep learning, and autonomous systems. Currently, he leads a team of AI researchers in the Programming Systems Research Group 
								at Intel Labs, where he is the lead principal investigator and co-founder of the $6M Intel-NSF joint CAPA Research Center, 
								which aims to simplify the programmability of heterogeneous computing. He also is responsible for directing Intel’s portfolio 
								of intellectual property related to machine programming (MP).
							</p>
							<div id="collapse-speaker" style="display:none">
								<p class="main"> Much research and engineering must be done before autonomous systems, like autonomous vehicles (AVs), can be fully realized. 
									Contrary to some AV experts’ opinions, it is Gottschlich’s belief that anomaly detection must advance significantly before we 
									will reach level 4+ autonomy. He believes that the current state of the art is not nearly advanced enough to be used reliably 
									and a level 3-only AV can put human lives at unnecessary risk. Sadly, this is partially why we have seen a rising number of 
									tragic AV fatalities.  
								</p>
								<p class="main"> To help address this problem, in December 2018, Gottschlich et al. published a paper at NeurIPS ’18, entitled 
									<a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/7462-precision-and-recall-for-time-series.pdf" target="_blank">“Precision and Recall for Time Series”</a>
									which re-defined the core mathematical foundation for the field of AD so the detection systems built using this new foundation 
									could be more reliable, especially in the context of time series. To that end, Gottschlich’s hope is that this work could 
									be used to improve the general robustness of new AD systems and eventually save human lives. To date, this model has already 
									been adopted by BMW, Intel, and Stanford.
								</p>
								<p class="main"> In the same year, Gottschlich, along with his fellow collaborators at MIT, published 
									<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FvztwHyfgmrPMdE0lkTLidnhjl2wHCrm/view" target="_blank">“The Three Pillars of Machine Programming (MP),”</a>
									detailing the ground-breaking efforts that are leading to significant advancements in software development productivity by partially or fully-automating 
									software development tasks that are currently performed manually.  They lay down a blueprint of how to fully unlock the power of MP and provide a 
									roadmap for its future evolution. Gottschlich's work in this area is significant because it is key to the strategic vision of several industry 
									leaders (e.g., BMW, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft). In fact, Facebook's creation of an <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2018/09/13/facebook-created-ai-based-tool-automate-bug-fixes/" target="_blank">
									AI-based tool to automate bug fixes in 2018</a> is an example of the “Adaptation Pillar” that Gottschlich wrote about in his paper.  
								</p>
								<p class="main"> Recent advancements in ML-centric computational hardware (e.g., GPUs, distributed computing, neural processors, etc.), key algorithmic discoveries and 
									techniques, and the vast amount of learning data now available are some of the reasons why interest in MP has exploded and why Gottschlich is fascinated 
									with this field of research.
								</p>
								<p class="main"> In 2016, he co-founded the ACM Machine Learning and Programming Languages (MAPL) workshop, and subsequently has been the chair and the program chair of MAPL and 
									TRANSACT. Previously, Gottschlich was the vice-chair of the C++ Standard Transactional Memory Working Group (SG5) during 2012 to 2014. 
								</p>
								<p class="main"> Gottschlich has led major projects and collaboration initiatives at some of America's top corporations, startups, and research working groups. He oversees and guides several Intel-driven ML research 
									projects at top universities such as Berkeley, Brown, MIT, Stanford, Texas A&M, and the University of Washington. He has mentored some of the smartest minds at America's top universities to solve 
									the problem of how to effectively build software for diverse hardware architectures. 
								</p>
								<p class="main"> In the corporate realm, Gottschlich oversaw an industrial collaboration between Intel and BMW on anomaly detection for autonomous vehicles.  Gottschlich was previously the director of engineering at 
									Machine Zone, where he oversaw the development of the popular video games, Mobile Strike and Game of War.  He is also the CEO of Nodeka, LLC, an online, multi-player software gaming company that he founded in 1999.
								</p>
								<p class="main"> On the research front, between 2015 and 2018, Gottschlich was awarded 20+ patents, with 50+ still pending. He also has 30+ peer-reviewed publications and has given 12+ presentations at conferences and 
									seminars at BoostCon, BMW, IBM Research, Penn, VMWare Research, etc. He won the “Best Presentation” award at several conferences (Intel SWPC 2016, CGO 2010, and Raytheon ISaC 2009).
								</p>
								<p class="main"> Gottschlich received his Ph.D. from the University of Colorado in Boulder, where he occasionally teaches a graduate-level course on neural networks. Last fall, at the University of Pennsylvania, 
									he co-lectured a graduate-level course on anomaly detection for safe autonomy.  </p>

								Gottschlich as a major influencer in the field of safe autonomy, thanks to his groundbreaking work in advancing the unification of academia and industry to collectively solve some of the most challenging technical 
								issues facing the world today.
							</p>
							<div id="collapse-precise" style="display:none">
								<p class="main white">
									Gottschlich is a spearpoint when it comes to intelligent, safety-critical systems. His early work focused on algorithms, parallel and distributed computing, computer architecture, embedded systems, software/hardware efficiency, 
									C/C++ systems optimization, software programability and productivity. Since then, Gottschlich's focus has shifted, and his more recent contributions are centered around intelligent, autonomous systems, with a strong emphasis on anomaly 
									detection. His work in this area of research is considered, by many, to be the defacto standard in the industry, due to his expansive knowledge of the implementation of physical systems, and the significant impact of his 
									innovations in the field.
								</p>
								<p class="main white">
									Gottschlich constantly strives to leverage AI for the advancement and benefit of people and society.  He represents a rare breed of researcher whose full-stack experience enables him to see problems in 
									unique ways that elude other researchers. Leveraging this foresight, Gottschlich has become a force multiplier in the Assured Machine Learning community by coordinating with Intel to fund and actively participate in foundational and 
									translative research focused on real-world problems plaguing AI systems.  We believe their cutting-edge work will be critical to advancing the next generation of safe, intelligent systems.
								</p>
								<p class="main white">
									PRECISE is truly honored to host Dr. Justin Gottschlich as our Keynote Speaker for Industry Day 2019, and give him the spotlight and recognition that he aptly deserves.
